Python Pandas
Knowing a Series
describe() or info()
It is possible to understand a Series better by using describe method.
The method provides details like mean, std, etc. about a series.
Two methods majorly info and describe can be used to know about the data, present in a
data frame.
describe provides details of only numeric fields.
to_csv()
write a data frame data to an output csv file
read_excel
used to read data from excel files
read_csv
used to read data from csv files
skiprows
method to skip first n lines of an input csv files
parse_dates
method to treat data of specific columns as dates
to_datetime
 convert a list of date like strings into datetime objects
Indexing
refers to labeling data elements of a Series, a Data Frame or a Panel
Data Aggregation
refers to identifying data satisfying a condition.
merge
method to join two data frames.
